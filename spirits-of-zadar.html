                            The cityscape seems tailored for transient visitors rather than its residents, a consequence

                        Spirit installations were created as an activist intervention inspired by the current problem of
                        thedisappearing of the city’s identity. In my work I referred to the city I grew up in, the city
                        of Zadar whoseproblem I’m most familiar with.It reaches the point in which the cities are shaped
                        for passersby not for its citizens. The monoculture ofmass tourism slowly erodes most of the
                        cities in the Mediterranean and they become just a facade shapedby cheap attractions tailored to
                        satisfy specific needs of temporary visitors.There are fewer and fewer people living in the
                        city...

                        Activist spirit installations are made as a reconstruction of the city’s ruins, but not in a way
                        that restorestheir former appearance, but represents the one thing the city needs the most; its
                        people.There is no city without people, they are its soul, its spirit.The spirit entity can be
                        perceived in two ways.A spirit can be seen as a monster, a remnant of something that was once
                        alive. Spirit represents death,dying, emptying, non-existence of the material. At the same time,
                        we can look at the concept of spirit asa part of identity: the spirit of space, the spirit of
                        time, the spirit of the city. Faced with a problem that islargely beyond my reach, the spirits
                        are my cry and demand that should initiate procedures of returningpeople to the city

                            "A city isn't made of stones, a city is made of people." It all starts with that crucial
                            point,
                            which is the lack of citizens, the lack of people. When there are no citizens, it's normal
                            that
                            there isn't what you are talking about, but if there were citizens, I would give them those
                            spaces, let them live, let them use them, those are spaces of their city, so their spaces.
                            However, the outflow from the city is still being supported. I emphasize, not only in Zadar.
                            This is a general problem of this mass, primitive tourism."""

                            Utilizing “Spirit” installations as scenic backdrops for cultural events not only addresses
                            the issue and captures media attention but also facilitates a dialogue through tactical
                            urbanism. These installations serve as a poignant call for citizens to reclaim their city,
                            erasing the label of an empty ghost town.
